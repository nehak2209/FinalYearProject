Notably, an early year spike in Emotet, a multipurpose malware, contributed significantly to the jump in backdoor activity observed year over year. Despite this spike in backdoor activity, ransomware, which held the top spot since at least 2020, constituted a large share of the incidents at 17%, reinforcing the enduring threat this malware poses.\n",
            "Phishing was the top initial access vector: Phishing remains the leading infection vector, identified in 41% of incidents, followed by exploitation of public-facing applications in 26%. Infections by malicious macros have fallen out of favor, likely due to Microsoft’s decision to block macros by default. Malicious ISO and LNK files use escalated as the primary tactic to deliver malware through spam in 2022.\n",

            "Exploits and zero day compromises: Extrapolating from our robust vulnerability database—which includes nearly 30 years of data—helps lend context to our analysis and identify the actual threat posed by vulnerabilities. This process also lends context to the diminishing proportion of weaponizable exploits and impactful zero days.\n",
            "Threat actor methods and their impact: Uncoupling the steps threat actors take during an attack from the actual impact of an incident allowed us to identify critical stages of an incident. This process, in turn, uncovered areas that responders should be prepared to handle in the aftermath of an incident.\n",

Credit card information, targeted 61% of the time in 2021, fell out of favor for threat actors—data shows it was sought in only 29% of phishing kits in 2022, a 52% decline.\n",
            "Share of global attacks that targeted the Asia-Pacific regionAsia-Pacific retained the top spot as the most-attacked region in 2022, accounting for 31% of all incidents. This statistic represents a five percentage point increase from the total share of attacks to which X-Force responded in the region in 2021.\n",
            "In 2022, X-Force moved from tracking initial access vectors as broader categories, such as phishing and stolen credentials, to the initial access techniques listed within the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise framework. This shift allows X-Force to track important trends more granularly at the technique level. It also provides more readily consumable and cross-comparable data and aligns with the broader industry’s standardization efforts.\n",
            "Across 2022’s penetration tests for clients, X-Force Red found that approximately 54% of tests revealed improper authentication or handling of credentials. The X-Force Red Adversary Simulation team regularly performed spear phishingwith QR codes targeting multifactor authentication (MFA) tokens. Many organizations lacked visibility into applications and endpoints exposed through identity access management and single sign-on (SSO) portals, such as Okta.\n",

Figure 2: Types of phishing subtechniques as a percentage of total phishing cases observed by X-Force in 2022. Source: X-ForceThis correlates to what past Threat Intelligence Index reports referred to as “vulnerability exploitation” and marks a drop from 34% in 2021.\n",
            "In third place, abuse of valid accounts (T1078) was identified in 16% of the observed incidents. These are cases where adversaries obtained and abused credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining access. These incidents included cloud accounts (T1078.004) and default accounts (T1078.001) at 2% each, domain accounts (T1078.002) at 5%, and local accounts (T1078.003) at 7%.\n",
            "According to X-Force Incident Response data, deployment of backdoors was the most common action on objective, occurring in 21% of all reported incidents. This was followed by ransomware at 17% and business email compromise (BEC) at 6%. Malicious documents (maldocs), spam campaigns, remote access tools and server access were discovered in 5% of cases each.\n",
            "In cases where a backdoor deployment was classified as an action on objective, it’s probable that the threat actor had additional plans when the backdoor was operationalized. Successful intervention by security teams or incident responders likely prevented the threat actor from fulfilling further objectives. Such further malicious activity would likely have included ransomware, as about two-thirds of those backdoor cases had the markings of a ransomware attack.\n",
            "Increased backdoor deployment may also be due to the amount of money this kind of access can generate on the dark web.Compromised corporate network access from an initial access broker typically sells for several thousands of US dollars. This type of access may be sought by malicious actors looking to make a quick profit by avoiding issues with maintaining access while moving laterally and exfiltrating high\u0002value data. Those malicious actors who lack access to the requisite malware to establish access themselves may also seek backdoors.\n",
            "ransomware: Even amid a chaotic year for some of the most prolific ransomware syndicates, ransomware was the second most common action on objective, following closely behind backdoor deployments and continuing to disrupt organizations’ \n",

            "Researchers first discovered Phobos ransomware in early 2019. Based on similarities in code, delivery mechanisms, exploitation techniques and ransom notes, Phobos was identified as a fork of the previously known ransomware families Crysis and Dharma. Phobos has been commonly used for smaller-scale attacks, which involve lower ransom demands. Email phishing campaigns and exploitation of vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports are the main distribution methods observed for Phobos.\n",
            "The analysis found that more than one in four incidents aimed to extort victim organizations—making it the top impact observed across incidents remediated by X-Force. The observed extortion cases were most frequently achieved through ransomware or BEC, and often included the use of remote access tools, cryptominers, backdoors, downloaders and web shells.\n",
            "Data theft came in second and accounted for 19% of all incidents that X-Force remediated. Credential harvesting that led to stolen usernames and passwords and required corresponding mitigations accounted for 11%. Incidents where X-Force could identify targeted information actually leaked after being stolen was less common than the theft of data at 11%. Impacts to brand reputation, such as disruption to the services clients provide to their customers, accounted for 9% of incidents. See Appendix for the full list of impacts X-Force tracked. Incidents that impacted victims’ brand reputation were mainly distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which are also frequently used to extort victims to pay money to stop the attack.\n",
            "extortion : While extortion is most commonly associated with ransomware today, extortion campaigns have included a variety of methods to apply pressure on their targets. These include DDoS threats, encrypting data and, more recently, double \n",
            "and triple extortion threats combining several previously seen elements. Another tactic that at least one ransomware group experimented with starting in 2022 was making the data they had stolen more accessible to downstream victims.

In 2023, X-Force \n",

            "2022 was a tumultuous year for ITG23—one of the most prominent Russian cybercriminal syndicates primarily known for developing the Trickbot banking Trojan and Conti ransomware. The group suffered a series of high-profile leaks in early 2022, after publicly backing Russia’s involvement in the war. Referred to as the ContiLeaks and TrickLeaks, they resulted in the publication of thousands of chat messages and the doxing of numerous group members. X-Force uncovered evidence indicating that ITG23 began systematically attacking in mid-April through at least mid-June of 2022—an unprecedented shift, as the group had not previously targeted Ukraine.Additionally, the group has seemingly retired two of their most high-profile malware families, Trickbot and Bazar, and shut down their Conti ransomware operation. Various reports have suggested that a significant reshuffling of personnel may be occurring, with the group splitting into several factions and some members moving on entirely.\n",
            "The shutdown of Trickbot and Bazar, which accounted for a significant number of infections in 2021, resulted in a void that has been quickly filled by malware families such as Emotet, IcedID, Qakbot and Bumblebee. Prior to its shutdown, ITG23 was still deploying Conti ransomware prolifically, accounting for a third of all ransomware engagements to which X-Force responded in the first quarter of 2022.\n",
            "The group also released a new version of their Anchor malware, a stealthy backdoor that the group had traditionally deployed against high-profile targets. The upgraded version discovered by X-Force, and named AnchorMail, has a novel email-based command and control (C2) communication mechanism. The C2 server uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure (SMTPS) and Internet Message Access Protocol Secure (IMAPS) protocols, and the malware communicates with the server by sending and receiving specially crafted email messages.\n",
            "After X-Force observed Raspberry Robininfection attempts impacting organizations in mid-May 2022, the enigmatic worm began spreading quickly within victims’ networks from users sharing Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices. The infections spiked in early June, and by early August Raspberry Robin peaked at 17% of infection attempts that X-Force observed. This peak was identified in the oil and gas, manufacturing and transportation industries. The 17% infection attempt rate in these industries is significant, since less than 1% of X-Force clients in total have seen the same strain of malware. X-Force also observed more Raspberry Robin activity from September through November 2022.\n",
            "The spread of USB-based worms is enabled through social engineering and requires some physical access to a network or endpoint to infect successfully, whether by a legitimate user or some other means. X-Force advises ensuring your security tools block known USB-based malware, implementing security awareness training and disabling autorun features for any removable media. In especially sensitive environments, such as OT or where air gaps exist, it’s safest to simply prohibit the use of USB flash drives entirely. If it’s necessary to allow them, strictly control the approved number of portable devices for use in your environment in addition to implementing the previous suggestions.\n",

A Texas man, for example, told U.S. News that his surgery scheduled for a CommonSpirit Health facility, was delayed on his doctor’s recommendation until the hospital resolved its technical issues. Meanwhile, up to 290 hospital systems were impacted by ransomware, according to security company Emsisoft, which also shared further insight into the CommonSpirit attack where more than 620,000 patients’ data was exposed in the attack. In other affected hospitals, critical systems that manage medication and doses were impacted and offline. Reportedly, a 3-year-old patient was given an overdose of pain medication, Emisoft said. Healthcare has been the preferred target of ransomware actors, in particular since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Hospitals and other high-value targets are much more likely to pay an attacker’s ransom demands in order to ensure continuity of care.

And now, legislators have said it: Cybersecurity is patient safety. That was an important takeaway from a 2022 paper from Sen. Mark Warner (D, VA.).
