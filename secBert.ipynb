Malicious documents (maldocs), spam campaigns, remote access tools and server access were discovered in 5% of cases each.\n",

Successful intervention by security teams or incident responders likely prevented the threat actor from fulfilling further objectives. Such further malicious activity would likely have included ransomware, as about two-thirds of those backdoor cases had the markings of a ransomware attack.\n",

Email phishing campaigns and exploitation of vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports are the main distribution methods observed for Phobos.\n",
            "The analysis found that more than one in four incidents aimed to extort victim organizations—making it the top impact observed across incidents remediated by X-Force. The observed extortion cases were most frequently achieved through ransomware or BEC, and often included the use of remote access tools, cryptominers, backdoors, downloaders and web shells.\n",
            "Data theft came in second and accounted for 19% of all incidents that X-Force remediated. Credential harvesting that led to stolen usernames and passwords and required corresponding mitigations accounted for 11%. Incidents where X-Force could identify targeted information actually leaked after being stolen was less common than the theft of data at 11%. Impacts to brand reputation, such as disruption to the services clients provide to their customers, accounted for 9% of incidents. See Appendix for the full list of impacts X-Force tracked. Incidents that impacted victims’ brand reputation were mainly distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which are also frequently used to extort victims to pay money to stop the attack.\n",

            "2022 was a tumultuous year for ITG23—one of the most prominent Russian cybercriminal syndicates primarily known for developing the Trickbot banking Trojan and Conti ransomware. The group suffered a series of high-profile leaks in early 2022, after publicly backing Russia’s involvement in the war. Referred to as the ContiLeaks and TrickLeaks, they resulted in the publication of thousands of chat messages and the doxing of numerous group members. X-Force uncovered evidence indicating that ITG23 began systematically attacking in mid-April through at least mid-June of 2022—an unprecedented shift, as the group had not previously targeted Ukraine.Additionally, the group has seemingly retired two of their most high-profile malware families, Trickbot and Bazar, and shut down their Conti ransomware operation. Various reports have suggested that a significant reshuffling of personnel may be occurring, with the group splitting into several factions and some members moving on entirely.\n",
            "The shutdown of Trickbot and Bazar, which accounted for a significant number of infections in 2021, resulted in a void that has been quickly filled by malware families such as Emotet, IcedID, Qakbot and Bumblebee. Prior to its shutdown, ITG23 was still deploying Conti ransomware prolifically, accounting for a third of all ransomware engagements to which X-Force responded in the first quarter of 2022.\n",
            "The group also released a new version of their Anchor malware, a stealthy backdoor that the group had traditionally deployed against high-profile targets. The upgraded version discovered by X-Force, and named AnchorMail, has a novel email-based command and control (C2) communication mechanism. The C2 server uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure (SMTPS) and Internet Message Access Protocol Secure (IMAPS) protocols, and the malware communicates with the server by sending and receiving specially crafted email messages.\n",
            "After X-Force observed Raspberry Robininfection attempts impacting organizations in mid-May 2022, the enigmatic worm began spreading quickly within victims’ networks from users sharing Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices. The infections spiked in early June, and by early August Raspberry Robin peaked at 17% of infection attempts that X-Force observed. This peak was identified in the oil and gas, manufacturing and transportation industries. The 17% infection attempt rate in these industries is significant, since less than 1% of X-Force clients in total have seen the same strain of malware. X-Force also observed more Raspberry Robin activity from September through November 2022.\n",
            "The spread of USB-based worms is enabled through social engineering and requires some physical access to a network or endpoint to infect successfully, whether by a legitimate user or some other means. X-Force advises ensuring your security tools block known USB-based malware, implementing security awareness training and disabling autorun features for any removable media. In especially sensitive environments, such as OT or where air gaps exist, it’s safest to simply prohibit the use of USB flash drives entirely. If it’s necessary to allow them, strictly control the approved number of portable devices for use in your environment in addition to implementing the previous suggestions.\n",

Vulnerable components in the web server. Microsoft said that IP addresses affected in the attacks against portions of India’s electric grid were running Boa, and many of those were IoT devices such as routers.

A Texas man, for example, told U.S. News that his surgery scheduled for a CommonSpirit Health facility, was delayed on his doctor’s recommendation until the hospital resolved its technical issues. Meanwhile, up to 290 hospital systems were impacted by ransomware, according to security company Emsisoft, which also shared further insight into the CommonSpirit attack where more than 620,000 patients’ data was exposed in the attack. In other affected hospitals, critical systems that manage medication and doses were impacted and offline. Reportedly, a 3-year-old patient was given an overdose of pain medication, Emisoft said. Healthcare has been the preferred target of ransomware actors, in particular since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Hospitals and other high-value targets are much more likely to pay an attacker’s ransom demands in order to ensure continuity of care. Attackers, meanwhile, understand how vulnerable health delivery organizations are to cyberattacks, most of which still run legacy equipment retrofitted to connect online in order to provide remote patient monitoring.\n",

And now, legislators have said it: Cybersecurity is patient safety. That was an important takeaway from a 2022 paper from Sen. Mark Warner (D, VA.).
